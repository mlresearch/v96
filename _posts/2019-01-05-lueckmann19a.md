title: Likelihood-free inference with emulator networks
abstract: Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) provides methods for Bayesian inference
  in simulation-based models which do not permit tractable likelihoods. We present
  a new ABC method which uses probabilistic neural emulator networks to learn synthetic
  likelihoods on simulated data - both ’local’ emulators which approximate the likelihood
  for specific observed data, as well as ’global’ ones which are applicable to a range
  of data. Simulations are chosen adaptively using an acquisition function which takes
  into account uncertainty about either the posterior distribution of interest, or
  the parameters of the emulator. Our approach does not rely on user-defined rejection
  thresholds or distance functions. We illustrate inference with emulator networks
  on synthetic examples and on a biophysical neuron model, and show that emulators
  allow accurate and efficient inference even on problems which are challenging for
  conventional ABC approaches.
