title: Consistency of ELBO maximization for model selection
abstract: The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a quantity that plays a key role in variational
  inference. It can also be used as a criterion in model selection. However, though
  extremely popular in practice in the variational Bayes community, there has never
  been a general theoretic justication for selecting based on the ELBO. In this paper,
  we show that the ELBO maximization strategy has strong theoretical guarantees, and
  is robust to model misspeciffication while most works rely on the assumption that
  one model is correctly speciffied. We illustrate our theoretical results by an application
  to the selection of the number of principal components in probabilistic PCA.
