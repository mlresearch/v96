title: "An Exploration of Acquisition and Mean Functions\r in Variational Bayesian
  Monte Carlo"
abstract: "Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC) is a novel framework for tackling
  approximate posterior and model inference in models with black-box, expensive likelihoods
  by means of a sample-e\x0Ecient approach (Acerbi, 2018). VBMC combines variational
  inference with Gaussian-process (GP) based, active-sampling Bayesian quadrature,
  using the latter to efficiently approximate the intractable integral in the variational
  objective. VBMC has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art inference methods
  for expensive likelihoods on a benchmark consisting of meaningful synthetic densities
  and a real model-fitting problem from computational neuroscience. In this paper,
  we study the performance of VBMC under variations of two key components of the framework.
  First, we propose and evaluate a new general family of acquisition functions for
  active sampling, which includes as special cases the acquisition functions used
  in the original work. Second, we test different mean functions for the GP surrogate,
  including a novel squared-exponential GP mean function. From our empirical study,
  we derive insights about the stability of the current VBMC algorithm, which may
  help inform future theoretical and applied developments of the method."
